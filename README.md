# [JSL10] Submission: Escaping Vanilla JS: Abstraction Challenge

**Overview**
  I had to navigate through three themed rooms that has their own challenges that I had to debug using the given Javascript code.

**Learning Experience**
  I debugged the code by:

  - correcting the ID used in the event listener for Room 1.
  - using the correct element ID when displaying results for Room 1.
  - adding the missing 'async' keyword to the JS concepts set.
  - correcting the function call to find the intersection of `jsConcepts`
    and `reactConcepts` for Room 2.
  - adding `await` before the promise in `navigateLabyrinth` to Ensure   
    asynchronous operations are handled correctly in Room 3.
  - adjusting the `findMostRecentBook` function to correctly compare 
    dates and find the most recent book.
  - fixing the `findIntersection` function to correctly determine the   
    intersection of two sets.
  - adding the `await` keyword before `new Promise` in    
    `navigateLabyrinth` to ensure the simulation of asynchronous 
     operations works as intended.

**Skills Learnt**

   - Debugging
   - Analytical thinking

**Learning Overview**
Overall, working on this project was fun. I learnt new terms and finally had clarity about the async await function. It was easy to debug too.
